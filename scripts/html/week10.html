                Understanding Digital Inequalities 

There is a disparity between people in the information obtained through technology. This can be anything from general knowledge or researching a topic to more specific tasks such as seeking health advice or buying products and services.  

Another form of digital inequality is the inequality of the skills required to use information technology. People who are on the lower end of the education scale often do not have the technical skills required to make good use of technology. This can put them at a further disadvantage in terms of education and job searching. 

The most commonly discussed type of digital inequality is the inequality of access to information technology. Often, people who are of a lower socioeconomic status have less access to new forms of information technology and are therefore put at a disadvantage compared to their higher-income counterparts. 

Digital inequality, as it is understood today, is the disinterest that arises in individuals and groups as a result of unequal access, use of, or impression of data and communication technology. Digital inequalities can occur between countries and regions or among specific groups of people located in the same country or region. The scope of digital inequality can be quite broad; it encompasses many different aspects of a person's relationship with information technology.      
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text">
                Factors Contributing to Digital Inequalities 

One simple example of pricing troubles that affect not only low-income homes but also schools and libraries would be the cost of computer software. Often, underfunded institutions are faced with problems of not being able to afford software upgrades or having access to software that is even slightly outdated. This only aids in creating a digital divide for these people who are not given the chance to develop or utilize skills and resources that allow effective use of digital technologies. Another commonality is that online services and products are cheaper than their physical counterparts. Those not able to access more expensive services and products are missing out on many conveniences, and the same can be said about people who are limited to dial-up or cellular access, which is a much slower connection and often times won't support modern-day internet applications. With the rate technology is being developed and the constant release of newer and better versions of products, it is already hard to achieve digital equality by being able to afford last year's simple technologies. 

When examining affordability, it is easy to conclude that not all individuals or families can afford to have state-of-the-art technologies or even access to the internet. In 2012, the median income for a US household was $51,017. It was noted that less than half of households reported having an actual broadband internet connection in their homes. This statistic alone proves that a significant amount of people rely on other means to access the internet, as opposed to substantial in-home connections or internet-ready cellular devices. When evaluating these statistics, it is important to think that there are families who do not even meet the criteria of the median income, and they are subject to the question of whether the internet should be a safe livelihood or just a luxury. Either way, the cost of numerous methods of digital access is just too expensive. 

There is always a reason for why a certain group of people do not have the same access to a product or service as others have. And the same goes for the reason why there are digital inequalities. There are several factors contributing to these digital inequalities and they can constantly change as technology advances. However, three of the most prevalent causes of these disparities are affordability, social and cultural acceptance, and knowledge.

              <p class="blog-text">
                Impact on Society 

The changes in job markets and migration patterns resulting from the information revolution have the potential to exacerbate social divides between nations. There is already a 'global digital economic order' emerging, which is heavily weighted towards the industrialized economies of the West. Gaps in access to ICTs between developed and developing countries are growing, as is evidenced by the fact that 82% of global internet users are located in the developed world. Skills in using ICTs are becoming a necessary requirement for many high-paying jobs, thus in developing nations, the 'brain drain' to developed nations already suffering from skilled labor shortages is likely to increase. As work and leisure activities move increasingly towards virtual domains, the exclusion of certain social groups and nations is likely to become more profound. In extreme cases, nations or social groups that are excluded from the virtual society may be reduced to the status of an information 'underclass', with severely diminished participation in many areas of life and 'citizenship' and little chance to rectify this situation. 

When considering the impact of digital inequality on society, we must remember that the gap between the technological haves and have-nots imposes far more serious consequences than just the sum of individual hardships. It has the potential to impact on the very structure and quality of society as a whole. The exclusion of groups and individuals from access to ICTs means that those who could benefit most from access are often the least likely to have it. This is most true in the case of low-income households where the parents desire to improve their children's education through ICTs but are unable to provide them with the tools to do so. The long-term result of this kind of exclusion is the creation of a disenfranchised underclass whose life chances are greatly diminished in comparison to those who have easy access to ICTs.

                Challenges of Incorporating JavaScript in HTML Websites 

                When incorporating a JavaScript in an HTML document, we are confronted with several challenges. The difficult issues faced in this process are largely due to the lack of familiarity with Java. JavaScript itself has shifting standards, which presents an issue in writing cross-browser code. Familiarity with JavaScript means one needs to recognize not only the best way to accomplish a task, but also the specific techniques that work best in the environments a site is targeted at. Thus, as a web developer I need to understand how to write and, more importantly, how to maintain cross-browser code. This is a skill that I struggle in and will take me a long time to develop. 
                
                2.2. Learning Curve for Web Developers 
                
                When compared to learning HTML, learning JavaScript takes additional time and attention to detail. Having very limited experience with Java as a coding language, makes it confusing for me so I am literally learning on the job. My very first encounters with Java was through games, with that view of JavaScript as gaming language I thought I'd catch on quickly however I underestimated the learning curve when encountering difficulties.
