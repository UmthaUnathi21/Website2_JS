              <p class="blog-text">
                Ethical Considerations in Web Development 

An important step toward incorporation of relational ethics in interaction design involves close examination of ethical considerations in web development. In keeping with the previously noted relational perspective, it is important to consider the implications of various development tools within the context of the web. Most research in web-based algorithmic injustices has focused on search engines, the reviewing of search results, and the production of advertisements related to specific search queries. While this is an important area of study, much of the focus has been on Google, and an array of unjust practices associated with Yahoo's search engine have been largely ignored. Yahoo has long been involved in human rights violations, and a patent from 2013 reveals an intent to use location data to determine the reliability of a person in a certain location, to then vary the quality/severity of the services provided. This could lead to marginalization in web-based content that would be very difficult to detect. This is a clear injustice; however, it is beyond the current scope of this paper, which aims to explore the broader array of algorithmic injustices that affect marginalized groups.     
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text">
                Impact of JavaScript on Algorithmic Injustices 

                A second example brings into play the recent popularity and ease of use in AJAX-based web applications. By providing seamless stored data updates to the end user and eliminating the need for page refresh, AJAX aids in creating a very intuitive and dynamic web experience. But when this is paired with database and/or search algorithms with AI characteristics, changes to user-derived data may have unexpected and undesired effects on the said user. 
                
                With the relational dynamic between developer and end user, what can be innocuous and routine data collection from a user may be an act carried out under the pretense of power and coercion. Taking data from form entries as an example, a user may only intend to submit the necessary information to successfully pass the input validation constraints. This is data that the user would perceive as necessary and relevant to the task at hand. However, in some cases, this data may be intercepted and further data mining scripts may extract additional information under the assumption that more is better or that the data will be useful for another task. This can lead to the user feeling violated and suspicious as to why certain data was added to his/her profile or why they later received targeted advertisements for specific products. 
                
                JavaScript stands as the most utilized and widely known programming language used in crafting the behavior of websites. Through intensive client-server interaction, JavaScript opens up several channels for information to be collected from the end user. This may engage simple form fields, passing user-derived data back to the server, or managing cookies and other session-based data. Although the channels opened by JavaScript are beneficial in creating a responsive and intuitive website, it is these very same channels that we must critically reflect upon due to their potential harmful side effects in relation to algorithmic injustices.

              <p class="blog-text">
                Strategies for Streamlining Interaction Design 

Finally, it is important to have some metric to gauge whether interaction design decisions are right or not. Much of the reason why algorithm biases still exist today is simply that it is difficult to tell whether one design decision is better than another, and we would like to avoid the same fate. 

Offering a set of best practices guidelines targeted specifically at web developers in creating clearer and simpler UIs is another approach. These might include many of the do's and don'ts mentioned in the previous sections, but tailored specifically to decisions that web developers will be making. 

Another approach might be to try to offer alternative interaction designs in areas where they might be too difficult to implement. Oftentimes, the reason a system has a bad interaction design is that the problem is inherently too difficult to design for. An AI subsystem might have a particularly bad user interface because the task of making a user interface for that subsystem is in itself a complex AI problem. In this case, it might be possible to attack the problem from both ends, the AI and the interface. If the AI problem is solved so that little thinking is necessary on the part of the user, it is possible that a simple interface will suffice. If this is not the case, it is still possible to offer the alternative design and save the simple design for a future different version of the system, hopefully without confusing the two. 

However, this might be a difficult suggestion to make, as sometimes the reason a website is confusing and difficult to navigate is simply design oversight and not because it was a deliberate design choice. Coming from the developers, this suggestion will be more readily accepted if tools can be provided that make it easier to adhere to the suggestion. An example of such a tool might be a cognitive walkthrough analyzer that takes a series of AJAX interactions and predicts the resulting possible states of the system and compares it to some desired global state to point out where things could go wrong. 

There are many different ways to approach improving the situation. A very specific approach would be to encourage companies to develop their websites in a simpler, more straightforward way. This way, users will not have to traverse through a convoluted series of links and pages to accomplish their tasks. Given the rising popularity of AJAX web development, it is even more important to suggest this now, as AJAX blurs the lines between traditionally separate pages and can introduce a higher level of complexity and possible paths of interaction.
