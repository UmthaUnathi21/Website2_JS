                Importance of Wireframes in Web Design 

Wireframes are a crucial part of the initial design phase for a screen design, i.e. the UI/UX for anything that has a screen - from mobile phones to kiosks to applications and websites. It is generally in this phase that any design flaws are found, and although any changes at this stage, in comparison to changes in the development phase, will be relatively cheap, it can highlight any flawed logic in the systematic layout of the design. This makes wireframes an important aspect of web development as it acts as a blueprint for the design and ensures it adheres to the criteria, as well as delivering an outline of development for the developer. If a suitable wireframe is produced, the developer can use it as a map for development without needing further input from the designer. This can be a massive cost and time-saving factor, as ideally, it is generally a good thing to try and keep the designer and developer separated and prioritizing their given tasks, which is something I will discuss in great detail later.  
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text">
                Clear Communication of Design Concepts 

Despite recent fluctuations in the popularity of web design methods, the development of interactive web systems is best done using traditional printed media analytical techniques and object-oriented programming, "despite the fact that most object-oriented design and programming methodologies have their roots in more traditional media design and analysis techniques." This style of development involves both design and analysis done on paper concurrent with the development of code. The end product of the analysis phase or design is a series of documents both static and dynamic that outline system functionality and the presentation of that functionality. Dynamic documents such as HTML representations of system state can be done directly from the system; however, static analysis phase documents are best done using visual languages and diagrams. This is where wireframes come into play. Wireframes are an "under representation" of a system's design. They are static, abstract, and stripped of any presentational or stylistic elements. This allows easy translation between parts of the system to "separate the forest from the trees," and they are the perfect vehicle for a visual language simulation. 

To begin, a visual language is a system of communication using visual elements. These elements stand in for, or represent, particular parts of the system being described and function in the manipulation of information of the system. Visage and the unaided mind of the designer are not sufficient to craft the code or to convey abstract ideas relating to the functionality and interaction with the system. What is required is a "lingua franca," a bridge between the abstract and the concrete, something that is shared by the entire development team and can be used as a reference when there is doubt about the direction of the design. This is exactly the purpose of a wireframe in the context of system development. 

The design process can be seen as a process of communication between an idea and the substance of that idea. The success of the process is directly related to how well the original idea is conveyed and how well it is understood. In the context of designing web pages and considering the fact that web pages are an intangible end product, the communication aspect of the design process is critical. The intangibility of web pages is a result of their being a display medium facing an audience. The screen is where communication takes place and is the platform for the interactive manipulation of information. In effect, communication with the audience is the totality of the web page. Therefore, web pages are the sum of the information to be presented and the presentation of that information. In order to facilitate this communication with screen-based information, a visual language and a tool for the manipulation of that language are required. This is where wireframes have their greatest impact.

                Iterative Testing and Refinement 

Alternatively, the IxD professional can take on a more formative evaluation of their design themselves. This can be achieved through techniques such as discount usability testing or expert reviews. A discount usability test is a method of user interface evaluation which is quick, fast, and easy to put together. Expert reviews can be performed informally with colleagues, and by keeping the intended user in mind, it can be evaluated how clear the design is and whether the interface would make the task easier for the specific user. This can then lead to the redesign or iteration of a specific part of the design, and thus the testing and refinement cycle begins again. 

Iterative testing and refinement involves the IxD professional repeatedly testing the design solutions and refining them. During this phase, the design is evaluated and alternative and divergent implementations are investigated. "What works" and "what does not work" can have the same end result. For example, if a user flow through a complex task is efficient, the user may be unable to recall the steps taken. Conversely, if the task is accomplished, some basic goals may have been missed. This mixed result is possible because there is frequently a trade-off between usability and additional factors such as features, speed, or cost. Test results provide explicit data about the degree to which a design meets specific usability objectives. This phase can be as formal as a usability test in a usability lab or as informal as asking a colleague to review it.
