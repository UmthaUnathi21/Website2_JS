              </h3>

              <p class="blog-text">
                Importance of Internet Access 

The economic impact has been immense due to internet availability. Because of internet access, the job market has increased as there are many job opportunities available for freelancing, and this appeals to a wide range of audiences. E-commerce is booming due to the ability to reach out to potential customers. Internet advertising is cost-effective compared to traditional methods, and there are globalization opportunities for entrepreneurs to promote their brands. All these would not have been possible without the availability of the internet. Given the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, internet access has been crucial as there are many who will be out of a job, and the internet provides an alternative to seek out job opportunities. This would not have been possible if not for the increased job market due to the internet. 

Internet access has become of great significance given that technology has greatly advanced in this modern society. This is affirmed by Kasapis (2020) who asserts that access to the internet as a fundamental right in this modern world, which has been characterized by the benefits that come with the availability of the internet. These benefits range from educational opportunities, economic improvements, and social connectivity, and they have influenced the world in a positive manner. The significance of internet access cannot be overrated. This is based on the fact that the current modern society has greatly changed due to the internet. Because of globalization that has been triggered by internet access, the world has now become a village. Information is being transferred within seconds of any event occurring, and this has made the view of the world as a place where people are closely knit despite the distance barriers. The significance of internet access here is that communication is now more efficient, with the presence of e-mail, social media, and instant messaging. Because of this, there are greater opportunities for interactions between people, and this has created a society where it is tightly knit unlike the older days. An efficient example would be the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. Because of internet access, people are now able to interact with one another virtually instead of being physically present. This reduces the risks of the virus further spreading and also enables interactions between people to continue.     
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text">
                Barriers to Internet Access 

Affordability is still a significant barrier to internet access for many people. While prices of hardware and access have dropped significantly over the years, in real terms they are still too expensive for those on low income. Even where access is heavily subsidized or provided free, some people still consider it a luxury that they cannot afford. In 2015, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimated that 15 percent of the world's population is still living on USD 1.25 per day. Clearly, this demographic must forgo the benefits of the internet to meet their basic needs. This represents a significant missed opportunity for the internet to contribute to poverty reduction through improved access to information, education, and various forms of e-work and e-commerce. 

The most significant barrier to internet access is poor or nonexistent physical infrastructure. This represents a huge disparity in information flow between developed and developing countries. Rural and remote areas within countries are also affected by infrastructure limitations. These areas are often overlooked, as they are costly and difficult to service. Therefore, people living in such regions are left with no access or only access via slow and unreliable connections such as dial-up. This is significant in that internet access has the potential to overcome the social exclusion of people in rural and remote areas and can act as a 'virtual migration', saving people the social and financial costs of moving to urban areas in search of information and opportunity.   
              </p>

              <p class="blog-text">
                Infrastructure Limitations 

Developed countries may not face such extreme situations, but infrastructure problems are still a concern. For example, in Japan, where the majority of the population is packed tightly into huge cities, surrounding rural areas are often left behind when it comes to infrastructure development. So, while the general infrastructure of Japan is excellent, there are still places without internet access due to distance from the closest connection point. These areas without internet are coined as "black zones". Black zones may also be caused by telecom companies not investing in the necessary infrastructure due to a small return on investment. All of these infrastructure limitations result in a barrier to internet access. 

Unfortunately, for some countries and areas, internet access is not possible due to infrastructure limitations. Infrastructure limitations can differ greatly depending on the area in question. In rural or underdeveloped areas, infrastructure limitations can simply mean that there are no means of internet access. Some areas may have the infrastructure required for internet access, but due to political/economic troubles or conflict, the infrastructure is severely damaged or cannot be maintained. These situations are common in areas affected by war or so-called "failed states". The saying "failed state" refers to a country that cannot or does not provide the most basic needs for its citizens. This includes but is not limited to protection, food, clean water, and shelter. These countries or areas are often at rock bottom in terms of infrastructure, and rebuilding to a point where internet access is possible can take years. 

The infrastructure of a nation can greatly affect the success of internet access. Internet is a connection of computers which allows information exchange. This exchange of information can occur in many different ways such as email, chat, video conferencing, e-commerce, and so on. Internet access itself is an inexpensive and effective way to exchange information nationwide, making it an extremely useful tool. It has become so useful and popular that the United Nations has deemed internet access a human right.

              <p class="blog-text">
                Policy Implications and Recommendations 

An important factor in this policy change is to attempt to redefine internet access as a utility. This would imply that internet access is an essential public service which can improve the lives of citizens and assist in the development of progressive societies. This change has already been noted in the case of remote and rural areas in the USA where broadband funding has occurred in areas which have little to no access to the internet. The employment of this policy would be of great benefit to developing nations in their quest to bridge the digital divide. As a fundamental right, internet access must be obtainable by all people and should not be segregated by social groups. By defining the internet as a necessary public service, it can be better provided to those in the Global South. A worthy recommendation for this policy change would be to make this a new millennium development goal. Should global poverty continue to decrease and internet access progresses at its current rate, this can be a realistic goal which can lead to improvements in global health and living conditions. 

These developments have positive implications on government policy changes regarding internet access and in relation to its classification as a fundamental right. The European Union is currently debating an electronic communications code which sets out to incentivize investment in high-speed internet. It is suggested that there will be added regulation to internet service providers to provide more effective services to consumers. Although the pretext of this code is to supposedly benefit the internal market, it could prove beneficial to providing a universal standard of internet access throughout the EU. Individual nations also have an increased interest in the digital economy. Investment in technological infrastructure can not only foster economic growth and competitiveness but also, as mentioned previously, improve access to the internet. Although in some cases government investment may not be feasible due to financial constraints, it must be understood that internet access is a right which transcends all forms of marginalized social groups. Investment in this area could prove beneficial in reducing existing social disparities. In particularly severe cases, aid may be required from supranational organizations such as the UN or WHO.
