                Importance of Internet Access 

Information oftentimes is a powerful weapon, and the potential of the internet in giving individuals a resource for information on their rights and the ability to organize to secure them is a large part of internet access being essential to human rights. 

The internet allows individuals to educate themselves on their rights that are guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, such as freedom of speech, ethnicity, minority or indigenous rights, language, employment, and economic security. For example, those whose rights to free speech are being oppressed now have a virtually free and accessible outlet through the internet to voice their opinions and seek like-minded individuals and groups that can help them take steps towards enforcing their rights. 

Internet access over the last decade has become recognized as a basic human right. It allows and assists individuals in exercising and enjoying their rights. Like all fundamental freedoms, the implications of internet access for human rights have both positive and negative aspects.      
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text">
                Challenges to Internet Access in South Africa 

Turning to specific human rights, there are a multitude of rights that internet access aids in realizing. For the purposes of concision, these can be categorized under political participation, access to information, and education. The prevention of internet access effectively prevents the realization of these rights by certain individuals. 

It is important to keep in mind that human rights set out moral principles on the standards by which human beings should live and are thus inherently universalistic, applying to all human beings without discrimination. This essentially means that all persons in South Africa are entitled to the human rights enabled by internet access, and the prevention of access prevents the equal realization of human rights for all persons in South Africa. 

With modern-day internet being the primary source of information and communication, connecting billions of people, it is not difficult to argue that internet access is a fundamental tool enabling the realization of many human rights. The United Nations Human Rights Council, on the 1st of July 2016, passed a resolution in support of the importance of internet access for enabling human rights and condemned measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to information online and the dissemination of information. This resolution by the United Nations demonstrates that the prevention of internet access prevents human rights and that measures to prevent access are both detrimental and unacceptable. 

In discussing challenges to the realization of internet access in South Africa, it is prudent to briefly define what is meant by internet access. Internet access can be defined as the ability to connect to the internet to potentially draw upon a wide range of services and connect with other people. Internet access today is primarily in the form of broadband – fast enough to enable the use of all services available on the internet. 

The previously mentioned assertions of human rights providing for the human condition and ability to partake in a meaningful and dignified life are difficult to dispute. The difficulty lies in ensuring that these assertions are meaningfully realized by all peoples, in all areas, and at all times. Challenges to the content and implementation of rights usually arise over who is to provide for those rights, who is to pay, and what is a just and reasonable means of ensuring their delivery to all peoples.

                Policy and Regulatory Reforms 

The IBSA research report of 2007 states policy and regulation are at the center of any strategy for promoting the attainment of the right to communicate, as policy and regulation constitute the underlying principles and directives from which derivative legislation, action plans, and regulatory measures are developed and implemented. The report recognizes the importance of ICTs as a tool to empower people and to address issues related to economic and social development. Despite the broad consensus that policy and regulatory reforms are essential to improving internet access in South Africa, there is little agreement on the exact steps that need to be taken. In the GISWatch report, Adam notes that there are many competing conceptions of policy and regulation, ranging from a focus on liberalization, privatization, and deregulation of the telecoms sector to a focus on creating pro-poor policies designed to help the most marginalized and disenfranchised members of society. He explains that since 1996, South Africa has focused on the former, despite the growing evidence that liberalization has not done enough to improve access for the poor. This sentiment is echoed by Gillwald and Stork, who note that policymakers have tended to equate market-friendly policies with the development of the ICT sector and that there is now a need to focus on policies that best meet the needs of the South African socioeconomic and political context. 

American policy analyst Nancy Scola states that "policy is the most powerful tool that government has at its disposal to address public problems." There is a broad consensus in the academic literature that a coherent and well-thought-out policy framework is essential for the development of the information society and Information Communication Technology sector. This is especially relevant to South Africa as it is clear that any major changes in the current state of events will require some form of policy change. According to the Balancing Act website, the most urgent policy issue is the creation of an "enabling environment." This refers to the idea that the correct policy and regulatory framework will attract investment and competition into the ICT sector.

              <p class="blog-text">
                Digital Skills Development and Education 

During the year 2007, a job placement and employment research website, announced that it would aggressively be targeting Unisys and IBM skills base and personnel to offer employment utilizing "telecommuting in international markets to help offset skills shortages in South Africa and developed markets". Measures can be taken to appeal directly to the availability of these skilled individuals and aid willing companies to employ telecommuters with cost incentives such as reduced payroll tax and financial help with internet service subscription costs. 

Another example would be providing unemployed ICT graduates with access to online content development and remote service delivery jobs. This type of employment can provide invaluable experience to fresh graduates and drastically improve their chances of finding long-term employment, as well as providing a platform to foster entrepreneurship in the ICT sector. 

For example, university programs such as computer science, information systems, and electrical engineering are all hosted at South African universities and are quite often the cause of bandwidth provisioning, a distant second to research and e-learning bandwidth provisioning. Academics in these departments could be given an opportunity to attend workshops to learn the advantages of using limited bandwidth to teach students, or the benefits of using more advanced web services at affordable prices to improve their education, communicate more effectively with students, and make lecture and seminar material more accessible.
